If the sequence is provided, you will be able to see the sequence when zoomed in far
enough. Also with the sequence, you can easily create new tracks with plots
(e.g. GC Skew, GC Content) or features (e.g. start/stop codons, ORFs) extracted
from the sequence.





Before creating a feature, a [LegendItem](LegendItem.html) and [FeatureType](FeatureType.html) should be created first
to describe the shape and color of the feature.

Create [FeatureType](FeatureType.html)
```js
new CGV.FeatureType(cgv, {
  // Name of feature type.
  name: 'CDS',
  // How to draw features of this type. Options: 'arrow' or 'arc'
  decoration: 'arrow'
});

```

Create [LegendItem](LegendItem.html)
```js
new CGV.LegendItem(cgv.legend, {
  // Text of LegendItem label.
  text: 'CDS',
  // Color of swatch beside legend item. Features associated with
  // this legend item will be drawn using this color. Colors can be rgb, rgba format
  // or as a string (e.g. 'blue').
  swatchColor: 'rgba(200, 150, 150, 0.8)'
});
```
